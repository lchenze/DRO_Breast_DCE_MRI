# A DRO for Simulation and Analysis of Breast DCE MRI Techniques

The Breast MRI Digital Reference Object (DRO) is a simulation platform to allow for the simulation and analysis of different acquisition techniques used for dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams.  The simulator and its uses are described in the paper: <br />
